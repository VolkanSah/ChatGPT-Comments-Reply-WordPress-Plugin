## Description

WPWM OpenAI (ChatGPT) Comments Reply is a plugin that uses OpenAI's ChatGPT to automatically reply to comments on your WordPress website. The plugin adds a "Reply with WPWM OpenAI" button to the comment line actions, which when clicked, sends the comment text to OpenAI's ChatGPT API and returns a suggested response.

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wpwm-openai-comments-reply.php` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Use the Settings->WPWM OpenAI Settings screen to configure the plugin. You will need to provide an OpenAI API key to use the plugin.
4. Use the "Reply with WPWM OpenAI" button to generate automatic replies to comments on your WordPress website.
